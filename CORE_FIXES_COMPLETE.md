# ✅ Core Fixes Implementation Complete!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### **Phase 1: Real API Integration** ✅
- **Connected to RAWG.io API** with your API key: `7195a7519b5844bf87df7b0f628c9d51`
- **Updated ApiService** with proper methods:
  - `fetchGames()` - Get paginated games
  - `searchGames()` - Search with query
  - `getGameDetails()` - Get specific game info
  - `fetchGamesByGenre()` - Filter by genre
- **Fixed GameModel** to properly parse RAWG's response structure
- **Removed mock data** - Now using real game data from RAWG

### **Phase 2: Persistent Storage** ✅
- **Added Hive** for local database storage
- **Created CollectionService** to manage game collection:
  - `addGame()` - Add to collection
  - `removeGame()` - Remove from collection
  - `isInCollection()` - Check if game exists
  - `getAllGames()` - Get entire collection
  - `clearCollection()` - Clear all games
- **Collection persists** across app restarts
- **Data is stored locally** on device

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Functionality** ✅
- **Pull-to-Refresh** on Discovery screen
- **Real-time Search** using RAWG API
- **Better Error Handling** with retry button
- **Loading States** with skeleton loaders
- **Smart Collection Button**:
  - Shows "Add to Collection" (blue) when not in collection
  - Shows "Remove from Collection" (red) when already added
  - Button disabled during loading

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If games don't load:**
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify `.env` file has correct API key
3. Check internet connection
4. Try pull-to-refresh

### **If collection doesn't save:**
1. Check console for Hive errors
2. Try clearing app data and restarting
3. Ensure write permissions on device

### **Console Messages to Look For:**
```
✅ .env file loaded successfully
🔑 API Key loaded: Yes (32 chars)
✅ Loaded 20 games from RAWG API
📦 Collection service initialized with X games
✅ Added [Game Name] to collection
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **API Key**: Keep it secret, never commit to Git
2. **Rate Limits**: Don't spam the API, use pagination
3. **Testing**: Use pull-to-refresh to see new data
4. **Collection**: Games are stored in Hive database
5. **Performance**: Images will cache automatically

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Your `.env` file is NOT in Git** - This is good for security
2. **Collection data is local** - Not synced across devices (yet)
3. **RAWG API is free** - But has rate limits
4. **Images load from RAWG** - Requires internet connection
